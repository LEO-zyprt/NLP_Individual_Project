This pull back on markets although it may have some nice rebounds along way I don't see why we wouldn't test $280-295 range short term. 

Maybe a few days rebound then some air pockets. Nothing is going to go straight down nor will it rebound w/o panic/flush out & snap back

The company declined to issue guidance for the second quarter in a row, but said on a call with analysts that it expects iPhone supply in the fall to be delayed for a few weeks.
